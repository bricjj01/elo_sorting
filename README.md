# elo_sorting
This repo contains my own original work on programs that estimate player skill level in any given zero sum game.
These programs utilize the elo rating system originally designed for gauging a chess player's skill level.

The mathematical formulae used in this program were originally conceived by Arpad Elo in the early 20th century. I do not make any claims of ownership over these concepts whatsoever.

However, the python and golang files within this repository are entirely my own work. These files may be used by anyone at anytime, so long as no profit is derived from their use.

These files may not be used to generate profit without my explicit written permission.
